My final attempt at my project was a complete restart of everything I had done before. I looked at multiple guides and tutorials and revamped my entire workflow. I am still using ControlNet and AnimateDiff, as they are essential, but I've also added IPAdapters and mouth/face masks to eliminate the poor lip-syncing. I am really proud of my output; I think this is by far the best result. I also tested it with a new Pixar style and a new clip to evaluate the functionality, as I had never experimented with different movie clips before.
