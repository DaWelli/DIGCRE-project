## Introduction
The Image2Image style transfer generates a stylized video by processing an original video using advanced AI models to change a single frame.

## Prerequisites
I strongly recommend that you install ComfyUI Manager, this extension allows you an easy way to install all custom nodes I have used. For my Process you'll also need FFmpeg to extract each frame from a clip.
