# **Video Style conversion**
DIGCRE project, by Dario Wellinger

This repo contains examples and dokumentation of what I did with ComfyUI for my DIGCRE project. I will split this dokumentation in half for [Image2Image](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Image2Image) and [Video2Video](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Video2Video) conversion.


## **Project describtion**

My project resolves around Style transfering input data, e.g. a movie clip as input and the output should looke like some sort of animation/anime.
