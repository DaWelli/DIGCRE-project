# **Video Style Conversion**
DIGCRE project by Dario Wellinger

This repository contains examples and documentation of my work with ComfyUI for the DIGCRE project. I have split this documentation into two parts: [Image2Image](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Image2Image) and [Video2Video](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Video2Video) conversion.

## **Project Describtion**

My project revolves around style transferring input data, such as a movie clip, to produce an output that resembles some form of animation or anime.

## **Output**
Since my .mp4 files are to large to preview via Github, you'll have to download the raw files. They are in the "Output" folder, for each iteration.
