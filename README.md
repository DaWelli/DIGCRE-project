DIGCRE project, by Dario Wellinger

This repo contains examples of what I did with ComfyUI. I will split this guide in half for [Image2Image](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Image2Image) and [Video2Video](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Video2Video) conversion.
