# **Video Style conversion**
DIGCRE project, by Dario Wellinger

This repo contains examples and dokumentation of what I did with ComfyUI for my DIGCRE project. I will split this dokumentation in half for [Image2Image](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Image2Image) and [Video2Video](https://github.com/DaWelli/DIGCRE-project/tree/main/Video2Video) conversion.


## **Project describtion**

My project revolves around style transferring input data, such as a movie clip, to produce an output that resembles some form of animation or anime.
